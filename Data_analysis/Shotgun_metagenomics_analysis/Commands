### This file summarized the commands and programmes used for the data analysis of the shotgun metagenomics datasets.
### Both BLAST and kraken2 analysis were performed in the supercomputer that uses the PBS job schedule system.

# Here is the general commands for BLAST analysis of both quality filtered nanopore reads and illumina contigs
# I used 14 cpus and 300 Gb memory for the analysis
